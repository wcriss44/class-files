The 3 week project is going to end up being a team based assignment.

We will likely be assigned our own rooms as teams to work in.

On 28th of April we will present our app.

Required:

Project plan with a minimum of weekly milestones prior to project.

Daily standups explaining your current progress during the three weeks.

Initial presentation of your goal and what the project will entail.

If you have a web app, it is required that your project is actually deployed. You can deploy to Heroku or another cloud solution of your choice.
