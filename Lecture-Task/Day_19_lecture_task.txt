Today we will talk about JOINs in SQL. Before we start, it is important to understand what joins are in the first place. Joins are a way of merging two sets together, using set theory. Lets look at the common types:

Inner join: intersection of two tables (what is in this table AND that table)

Outter Excluding join: union of two tables (what is unique to this table AND unique to that table)

FULL OUT JOIN
