Today we will talk about JOINs in SQL. Before we start, it is important to understand what joins are in the first place. Joins are a way of merging two sets together, using set theory. Lets look at the common types:

Inner join: intersection of two tables (what is in this table AND that table)

Outer Excluding join: union of two tables (what is unique to this table AND unique to that table)

FULL OUTER JOIN (also known as FULL JOIN): The set of everything in both tables

LEFT JOIN: The set of all entries from the left. If the left side does not have a matching entry on the right it will get a NULL value for the right fields.

RIGHT JOIN: The set of all entries from the right. If the right side does not have a matching entry on the left it will get a NULL value for the left fields.

The syntax:

    SELECT [the fields you want]
    FROM [left table]
    [type] JOIN [right table]
    ON [left value = right value]
    WHERE [conditions you want]

A working example:

    SELECT users.name, games.name, games.genre, games.release_year
    FROM users
    JOIN games
    ON users.id = games.user_id

Now lets open our ForumWeb project and and import the following library using maven:
