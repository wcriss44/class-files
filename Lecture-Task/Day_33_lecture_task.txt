Today we will be talking about Jhipster. Jhipster is an application generator that generates a Spring Boot application with Angular for the front end. Here are the commands and installs you need for this:

npm install -g bower

now run the following: which gulp

if you see a path you can skip this. If not, run this: npm install -g gulp-cli

now install JHipster:

npm install -g generator-jhipster

now you can use JHipster to make your application. From the terminal, run the following:

$ cd ~/workspace
$ mkdir GameSales
$ cd GameSales
$ yo jhipster

You will be prompted for several questions. Enter the following:


choose either monolithic or microservices app (try monolithic 1st)
enter PROJECT_NAME
package name: com.theironyard.novauc
Authentication: stateful
Social login: no (skip for now)
Database type: SQL
Database engine Production: PostgresSQL
Database engine Development: H2
Hibernate cache: yes
Build tool: Maven
Social / Search / etc: skip
CSS preprocessor: no
internationalization: yes
native language: English
addâ€™l languages: French and Japanese
testing framework: Gatling (or perhaps Cucumber later)

Websockets: no

After testing out your application, our next task is to add a new Class called Customer. To do this, run the following commands:
