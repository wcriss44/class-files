Day 3 lecture task

make new project
rename class(From main to game)
rename file
  in sidebar
  right click main.java
  refactor and rename file

Add print statements(welcome).. println
use Scanner
  import java.util.scanner
  make scanner object, named scanner
  make a String called name, set to equal the nexLine() method of the new scanner object.

Welcome user to the game
    print welcome + name variable
Choose a weapon(sword, mace)
read into string named weapon
    use scanner.nextLine() method

Confirm weapon choice and do stuff!
  if weapon is sword
    print a message
  else if
    print another message
  else
    tell them it is wrong, throw exception

Have user select location(forest, tunnel)
  if forest
    print a message
  else if
    print another message
