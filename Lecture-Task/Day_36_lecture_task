Today's lecture is on project management. The highlight topic is Agile project development, specifically Scrum.

Project management is a broad topic, but some of the key areas managed through project management are:
    constraint gathering
    project breakdown into task
    time
    customer relations
    key stakeholder relations
    employees / developers

Project managers are responsbile for the project from inception to completetion, and often for some time after due to maintenance.

Lets take a look at an older project management methodology. Waterfall has been around for quite a few years, starting around 1970.

Waterfall takes the following approach:
    gather requirements - customer constraints
    Analysis  - models, schema, and rules
    Design  - project breakdown, wireframes, software architecture
    Coding  - development
    Testing - discovery and debugging
    Operations - install and maintenance

The biggest problem that waterfall faces is client requirements may be different than the finished product for many reasons: business requirements might change, communication might of been unclear, or new features might be added.

The waterfall methodology takes a linear approach, and as such, the project isn't ready for "testing" until all of the coding is completed. This is the underlying cause of the problems that waterfall faces.
