Open Android studio and create a new project called ToDoAndroid

Change the name to ToDoAndroid and make an app for phones. Select blank activity and click finish. Now you can program some apps!

Now select the phone icon and select the one with x86

AVD = Android Virtual Device
SDK = Software Development Kit

run your phone

now go to activity_main.xml under Res -> layout

delete textview

Select LinearLayout(Veritical) and drag it onto rootview

now add a listview to your linearLayout(veritical)

Next, add a horizontal layout to your linearlayout view


inside of the horizontal layout, add a button and a text field

now change the text of Button to: Add

Next, go to projects -> MainActivity class and add some code!

Make sure to do the imports for each (android.widget.....)

ListView list;
EditText text;
Button add;
Now add an ArrayAdapter to hold String objects:
    ArrayAdapter<String> items;

now add this to onCreate method:

list = (ListView) findViewById(R.id.listView);
text = (EditText) findViewById(R.id.editText);
addButton = (Button) findViewById(R.id.button);

the syntax for this is: declared variable name outside of onCreate is assigned the typecasted (type) of findViewById method with R.id.IDDECLAREDINXML as a parameter.

next, still inside onCreate, assign items to a new ArrayAdapter:

items = new ArrayAdapter<String>(this, android.R.layout.simple_list_item1);
list.setAdapter(items);

Above we declared items as an ArrayAdapter object that holds string objects. Inside of the onCreate method we assign a new ArrayAdapter to this object, and use the value of this and android.R.layout.simple_list_item1 for the constructor.
Next we set the adapter for list using the setAdapter method and pass in the value of items.
