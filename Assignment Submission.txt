Steps for assignment submission:

Fork the assignment
Verify that the assignment is on your actual GitHub page
    - it should read: "username/assignment name" at the top
click clone and copy the URL

Open your terminal
  change your directory to your Code directory
  clone the files from GitHub with the correct git command
        -tip: google search for command line git clone
  create a new branch with your lastname_assignment name as the name
  check out that branch
        -tip: google search git commands for branch and how to check them out
  verify everything is good
        -tip: Get a status?

*** Open intelliJ and do some coding!!!!!

When you are finished, you need to send the assignment in for submission
  go back to the terminal
  verify you are in the right directory
  Add your files to git
        -tip: Google search how to add files in git
  You also need to commit those files!
        -tip: Google search commiting in git

Almost done! Go back to your GitHub repository and do a pull request. Make sure that this is a pull request from your repository (username/assignment) and that it is on your new branch(should be lastname_assignment)!

once you do a pull request, copy the link and paste it into NewLine's assignment submission.

All done! Rejoice!


When you to try push and get an error that says 
"
~/Code/[folder] ([name]_[project]) $ git push origin [name]_[project]
remote: Permission to NOVA-Uncommon-Coders/[project].git denied to [you_git_name].
fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/NOVA-Uncommon-Coders/[project].git/': The requested URL returned error: 403
"
Then, if you're brave, do the below. WARNING you must be certain that you're on the correct folder, 'rm -r' removes all *git* files and folders within the current folder. (rm = remove, -r = recursively, -f = attempt to remove files without asking for further permission, ./.git = files that start with .git) 
rm -r -f ./.git
git init
git remote add origin [URL]
git checkout -b [your_project_name]
